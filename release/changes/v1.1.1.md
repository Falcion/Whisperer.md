## v1.1.1

This patch fixes issues #23 and #23 after previous (v1.1.0) release:

- issue #23: local audio player didn't work, now this issue is fixed;
- issue #24: plugin was spamming errors in console when handling opening files (metadata music option), this also fixes issues when meta music didn't work.
